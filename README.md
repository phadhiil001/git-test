- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this project, I gained practical experience in structuring a web page for both responsiveness and accessibility. I learned how to use CSS Flexbox to create a layout that is centered both horizontally and vertically, ensuring that the design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. This included working with media queries to make the content responsive across various devices, from mobile phones to large screens.

I also deepened my understanding of box model properties, such as padding, margin, and box-shadow, to enhance the visual appeal of the design while maintaining clean and readable code. By utilizing custom properties (CSS variables), I practiced making the styles reusable and easy to manage.

On the accessibility side, I focused on ensuring compliance with WCAG guidelines, particularly by testing color contrast ratios, adding meaningful alt attributes to images, and making interactive elements keyboard-accessible with proper focus styles. These practices reinforced the importance of creating web content that is inclusive for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.

Lastly, I enhanced my design skills by experimenting with font styles, sizes, and hierarchy to improve the user interface. This project taught me the value of attention to detail in web development, and it gave me a strong foundation for future projects that require a focus on both design and user experience.
